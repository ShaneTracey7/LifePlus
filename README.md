This app solves the problem of not having an effective space (on my phone) to house lists, mainly To-Do lists. Previously, I was using my notes app (on my iPhone) to keep my lists, but I've thought for a long time that there had to be a better way.
I have looked for a solution on the app store, bu there wasn't a right fit for me.

The app helps prevent procrastination and lack of motivation through the use of a reward system. There is a set amount of points for each task the user completes, that can be used to redeem default or user-generated rewards, such as getting fast food.

The app also has a permanent daily, weekly, and monthly To-Do lists where the user can set default item's that remain there after the lists reset every day, week, and month.
